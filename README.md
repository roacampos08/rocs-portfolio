# Rodrigo's Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience as an aspiring Data Analyst. It's built with modern web technologies to provide a clean, responsive, and engaging user experience.

Full, scoped and component-friendly CSS support for JSX (rendered on the server or the client).
## âœ¨ Features

Code and docs are for v3 which we highly recommend you to try. Looking for styled-jsx v2? Switch to the [v2 branch](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx/tree/v2).
- **Modern & Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a utility-first, mobile-friendly layout that looks great on all devices.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implemented with [Lenis](https://github.com/studio-freight/lenis) for a fluid and pleasant scrolling experience.
- **Interactive UI**: Features a custom cursor and subtle animations on interactive elements to enhance user engagement.
